Basically, Const and Int are confined to their function / if or whaterver that includes them within curly brackets.
But var can be accessed from the outside

Comparison:
A function is a dog kennel, won't let Const and Let out. But Var can leave.

Do if you create a Const within a fn(), you cannot access the const from outside the fn()
But you can access the created var from outside the fn()

example:
<script>
    const num = 123;
    if (num == 123){
        const greetings = "Hello 123";
    }
    console.log(greetings);
</script>
In this script, console log can get const num, but not const greetings

But if it's var greetings instead, you can console log "Hello 123"
